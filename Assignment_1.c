Computers speak in binary because of how they are built. A computer is nothing more than a vast collection of switches.
There are millions of nanoscopically small electronic switches on those oddly etched boards within the computer.
A switch, unless it's busted, can be either on or off, closed or open.

    A Text Editor is simply an application where we can type text and save it for later purposes.
    On the Other hand A Code Editor does something more with the help of Compiler.
    A Code Editor is used to write programming codes.

    Steps to Develop software using C language:
    1. We write plain text (code) in our code editor.
    2. Preprocessor reads our code and removes all the libraries starting with # and put definitions 
    of functions used of those libraries. It Converts the file into extended c program.
    3. Now, Compiler comes into the picture and it does all of his work 
    It converts that extended C Program to Assembly Code
    4. Assembler performs its task then and converts that file into .o extension which is object code.
    5. Linker is then responsible to convert that file into executable file which is .exe.

    A System Software is a Software which is installed in our computer

    An Application Software is a software which we can download on any platform (OS).
    These Apps. can be installed and deleted without facing any issue.

An easy method of converting decimal to binary number equivalents is to write down the decimal number and 
to continually divide-by-2 (two) to give a result and 
a remainder of either a “1” or a “0” until the final result equals zero.*/
